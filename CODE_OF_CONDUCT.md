*This document describes our team social contract for this project*

Reference Establishing Norms
Roles - switch every 3 days
Taskmaster - summarize tasks onto waffle io and make sure tasks are in appropriate columns 
Gitmaster - make sure everyone uses Gabe’s convention
Testmaster - making sure they’re written and passing - ask fellow for guidance on how many? 1-2 per feat?

Daily process
Morning standup started by current Taskmaster
New roles assigned in rotation
Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
Pair program on assigned tasks, based on task size/complexity
Use your discretion in bringing up any blocking issues 
At 5:20pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, feel free to reach out
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on

Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
